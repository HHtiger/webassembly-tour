# WebAssembly Tour

WebAssembly on Rust is a bright future in making application runs at the Edge or on the Serverless technologies. 

We spend a lot of time researching and doing a deep dive into it. We have documented it as the [`mindmap`](https://plantuml.com/mindmap-diagram) diagram so that it might help people like me to save time to search around the internet to find useful documents and tools to get started with WebAssembly on Rust.
